# Healthcare Sales Funnel Chat Feature

## Overview
The new sales funnel approach transforms your healthcare chat from a comprehensive information provider into a **lead generation and conversion tool**. Instead of overwhelming users with information, it follows a strategic funnel:

1. **Brief Medical Answer** (Build Trust)
2. **Ask for Help** (Generate Interest) 
3. **Specific Referrals** (Convert to Action)

## New API Endpoint
- **URL**: `/api/chat/sales-funnel`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Sales-focused healthcare assistance

## How It Works

### Step 1: Intent Analysis (Quick)
- Analyzes user's health question in seconds
- Detects emergencies immediately
- Identifies medical specialty needed
- Generates brief, helpful answer

### Step 2: Brief Medical Response
- Provides 2-3 sentences of helpful medical information
- Always includes medical disclaimers
- Non-diagnostic, educational content only
- Builds trust without overwhelming

### Step 3: Sales Conversion
- **Non-Emergency**: "Would you like help finding the right healthcare provider?"
- **Emergency**: Immediate facility and insurance recommendations
- **Follow-up**: Specific next steps for scheduling and coverage

### Step 4: Targeted Recommendations
1. **Proprietary Data First**: Uses your Google Sheets data
2. **Partnership Tier Priority**: Premium partners shown first
3. **Web Search Fallback**: If no proprietary data exists
4. **Targeted Insurance**: Specialty-specific insurance plans
