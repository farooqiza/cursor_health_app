# Transparent Data Scraping Feature

## Overview

The AI Health Assistant now provides **real-time transparency** into the data scraping process, showing users exactly which trusted sources are being accessed to ensure they receive the most reliable and comprehensive health information.

## How It Works

### Real-Time Progress Display

When users submit a health query, instead of a simple loading spinner, they now see:

1. **Current Action**: What the system is currently doing (e.g., "Searching live pricing from medical providers...")

2. **Trusted Source List**: A dynamic list of the specific databases and sources being accessed, such as:
   - Dubai Emergency Services Database
   - Hospital Emergency Departments
   - DHA Emergency Guidelines
   - Healthcare Pricing Database
   - DHA Fee Guidelines
   - Private Clinic Pricing
   - Insurance Fee Schedules
   - Medical Literature Database
   - Clinical Knowledge Base
   - Evidence-Based Medicine

3. **Progress Timeline**: A chronological view of all steps taken during the research process

4. **Quality Assurance**: Footer showing commitment to DHA-licensed providers and evidence-based sources

### Data Source Prioritization

The system demonstrates **hierarchical source prioritization**:

1. **Primary Sources**: Live web scraping from official medical provider websites
2. **Secondary Sources**: Curated local databases with verified information
3. **Fallback Sources**: Comprehensive backup data to ensure users always get helpful information

### Technical Implementation

#### Streaming API (`/api/chat/stream`)
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress updates
- Provides step-by-step transparency into the 3-stage process:
  1. **Intent Analysis**: Understanding the health query
  2. **Data Collection**: Gathering from multiple trusted sources
  3. **Response Synthesis**: Creating comprehensive health advice

#### Progress Components
- **ScrapingProgress**: Main component displaying real-time source access
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status indicators and source lists
- **Transparent Messaging**: Clear explanations of what's happening at each step

## User Benefits

### Trust Building

## Implementation Example

```typescript
// Progress update structure
interface ProgressUpdate {
  type: 'progress' | 'complete' | 'error';
  step: string;
  message: string;
  sources: string[];
  status: 'analyzing' | 'searching' | 'web_searching' | 'generating' | 'complete' | 'fallback';
  count?: number;
}

// Example progress update
{
  type: 'progress',
  step: 'web_pricing_search',
  message: 'Searching live pricing from medical providers...',
  sources: [
    'Hospital Websites',
    'Clinic Pricing Portals', 
    'Medical Fee Databases',
    'Real-time Healthcare Data'
  ],
  status: 'web_searching'
}
```

## Quality Assurance

### Source Verification
- All sources are verified and regularly updated
- Priority given to DHA-licensed providers
- Evidence-based medical information prioritized

### Fallback Systems
- Multiple layers of fallback ensure information is always available
- Local curated databases provide reliable backup data
- System never leaves users without helpful information

### Transparency Standards
- Clear indication when using fallback vs. live data
- Source quality levels clearly communicated
- Process failures gracefully handled with user notification

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Source credibility scoring
- User preference for specific source types
- Detailed source descriptions and credentials
- Historical source reliability tracking

### Integration Possibilities
